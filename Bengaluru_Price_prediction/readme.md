This Project is about Real-Estate price prediction. In this Project we have build a model that predicts home prices in Benglore city according to the area in which home is located, total square feet, total number of Bathrooms and total BHK. 
This is a Spervised learning model Project.
The Process Folw of Project is like,

1. Used home price dataset of banglore city from kaggle to implement model.
2. Used NumPy and Pandas for Data Cleaning.
3. Performed feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
4. Removed Outliers using mean, SD and domain knowledge.
5. Used Matplotlib for Data Visualization.
6. Used One-Hot Encoding to convert text data into categorical data.
7. Used Sklearn for model building
8. Used GridSearchCv and Crossvalidation to implement best model.
